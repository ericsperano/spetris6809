# Sp√©tris6809

A simple text based Tetris clone written in 6809 assembler for the Tandy Color Computer.
This is meant to be just a little fun learning project to teach myself 6809 assembler for the computer of my childhood.

Largely based on this excellent tutorial from Javidx9 on how to write a text mode Tetris clone in C++ for Windows:

## Implementation

It uses the CoCo ROM subroutines to generate pseudo random numbers and to poll the keyboard.
